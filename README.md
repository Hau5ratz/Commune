# Commune

Abstract:

Commune is a agile and open source, high utility self establishing system of organization.

Commune seeks to disrupt descision making process and system solution finding not based on nepotism but on priorization of substance over style for all purposals for change and solutions to problem.
Most importantly commune seeks to prioritize the delegations of authority to "each according to thier contribution" over all else

Key:

Demand: A demand is an issue, gap, or challange that demands a purposal to solve.
Purposal: A purposal is an imagined solution/modification to a process/problem/means of something these are what are sent for review

Editor: These are members who if they have a signficiant quantity of R-merit in a certain competency they may screen purposals and co-ordinate reviews and purposals to a solution state

Compentency: Each passed review/purposal Earns R-merit that is compentency specific, privledges are only awarded within a competency except.

R-merit: R-merit is the metric for accessing commune engagement and reputation. Certain activities increase one's R-merit while others decrease one's R-merit. R-merit. When earned has a Half-life set by the commune to encourage constant participation and engagement in order to maintain privledges within the commune.
