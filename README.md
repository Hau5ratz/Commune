# Commune

Abstract:

Commune is a agile and open source, high utility self establishing system of organization.

Demand: A demand is an issue, gap, or challange that demands a purposal to solve.
Purposal: A purposal is an imagined solution/modification to a process/problem/means of something these are what are sent for review

Editor: These are members who if they have a signficiant quantity of R-merit in a certain competency they may screen purposals and co-ordinate reviews and purposals to a solution state

Compentency: Each passed review/purposal Earns R-merit that is compentency specific, privledges are only awarded within a competency except.

R-merit: R-merit is the metric for accessing commune engagement and reputation. Certain activities increase one's R-merit while others decrease one's R-merit. R-merit. When earned has a Half-life set by the commune to encourage constant participation and engagement in order to maintain privledges within the commune.
